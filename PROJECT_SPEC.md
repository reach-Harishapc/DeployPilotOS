# 🚀 DeployPilotOSOS — Autonomous AI DevOps Agent
### OpenAI Build Week 2026 — Developer Tools Track
---

## 💡 The Big Idea

**DeployPilotOS** is the world's first **autonomous AI DevOps agent** that monitors your production apps, diagnoses incidents in real time, runs recovery playbooks, and rolls back bad deploys — all without a human needing to lift a finger.

Every dev team has experienced this: 3 AM, production is down, you're staring at a wall of logs trying to figure out what went wrong. DeployPilotOS is the senior SRE engineer that never sleeps. It watches your stack 24/7, understands what "normal" looks like, and when something breaks — it acts.

**This is not a dashboard. This is an agent that DOES things.**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Production incidents are expensive:
- Average cost of downtime: **$5,600/minute** (Gartner)
- Average time to detect an incident: **207 days** for security breaches
- Average MTTR (Mean Time to Recover): **4.2 hours** for most teams
- On-call engineers are burned out, woken at 3 AM, and spend hours debugging

Current tools (Datadog, PagerDuty, Grafana) send **alerts** — then leave humans to figure out what's wrong. They are reactive dashboards, not intelligent agents.

**DeployPilotOS closes the loop:** detect → diagnose → act → report. Autonomously.

## 🔥 OpenAI APIs Used — Maximum Technical Score

| OpenAI API | How DeployPilotOS Uses It |
|---|---|
| **GPT-5.6 + Function Calling** | Core reasoning engine — reads logs, diagnoses root cause, decides actions |
| **Assistants API** | Persistent agent with memory of your infrastructure and past incidents |
| **Realtime API (WebSockets)** | Voice Incident Commander — talk to DeployPilotOS live during outages |
| **Structured Outputs** | Every agent decision is a guaranteed-valid JSON action plan |
| **GPT-5.6 Streaming** | Live streaming diagnosis narration in the UI |
| **Embeddings API** | Semantic log search + pattern matching across historical incidents |
| **TTS API** | DeployPilotOS reads incident alerts aloud (voice notifications) |
| **Moderation API** | Screens runbook commands before execution for safety |

---

## 🧩 Core Features (All 7)

### 1. 🔴 Real-Time Anomaly Detection
- DeployPilotOS continuously polls your services' metrics via configurable adapters:
  - HTTP health endpoints
  - Response time / latency spikes
  - Error rate (4xx/5xx) thresholds
  - CPU / Memory (from Docker stats API or cloud provider APIs)
  - Custom metrics via webhook push
- Anomaly detection uses a **rolling baseline model**: GPT-5.6 analyzes the last N data points and determines if current behavior is statistically anomalous
- When anomaly detected → **Incident opened automatically**
- Severity scored: `P1 (Critical) | P2 (High) | P3 (Medium) | P4 (Low)`

### 2. 🔬 Incident Auto-Diagnosis
- When an incident opens, the **GPT-5.6 Diagnosis Agent** activates:
  - Fetches recent logs from the affected service (last 500 lines)
  - Fetches recent deploy history (what changed recently?)
  - Reads error traces / stack traces
  - Correlates with other services (is it upstream/downstream?)
  - Reasons step-by-step (Chain of Thought) to find root cause
- Output: a **human-readable diagnosis card**:
  - Root cause (best hypothesis)
  - Evidence (specific log lines, metrics that support the hypothesis)
  - Confidence score (0-100%)
  - Recommended actions (ordered by likelihood of success)
- Streams in real-time to the UI as the AI thinks

### 3. ⚙️ Autonomous Runbook Execution
- Pre-define runbooks in plain English (e.g., "If the API is slow, restart the web workers")
- DeployPilotOS matches incidents to runbooks using Embeddings (semantic matching)
- Agent executes runbook steps autonomously via **Function Calling**:
  - Restart a service
  - Scale up replicas
  - Clear a cache
  - Rotate secrets
  - Run a database vacuum
  - Flush a queue
  - Call a custom webhook
- Each step is **narrated in the UI**: "Executing step 2: Restarting web-server-01..."
- Each step is **safety-screened** via Moderation API before execution
- Full audit trail of every action taken

### 4. 🔄 Auto Rollback
- DeployPilotOS tracks every deploy with timestamps and version IDs
- When diagnosis confidence is high (>80%) and root cause is "bad deploy":
  - Proposes rollback with explanation: "Deploy v2.3.1 (pushed 14 minutes ago) introduced a breaking DB migration. Rolling back to v2.3.0."
  - **One-click human confirmation** OR **fully autonomous** (configurable)
  - Executes rollback via configured integration (GitHub Actions trigger, Vercel API, Railway API, Render API, Docker tag swap, Kubernetes rollout undo)
  - Verifies health after rollback (runs health check suite)
  - Marks incident resolved if health restored

### 5. 📣 Slack / Notification Integration
- Every incident triggers a rich **Slack notification** written by GPT-5.6:
  - Incident title + severity badge
  - Auto-diagnosis summary (plain English, no jargon)
  - Actions taken so far
  - Current status (Investigating / Mitigating / Resolved)
  - Link to full incident in DeployPilotOS dashboard
- **Incident update messages** sent as AI continues diagnosing
- **Resolution message** with root cause + actions taken + time to resolve
- Also supports: Email, PagerDuty webhook, Discord, Microsoft Teams

### 6. 🎙️ Voice Incident Commander (Realtime API — MOST IMPRESSIVE)
- During a P1/P2 incident, click **"Start War Room"**
- Full-screen voice UI powered by **OpenAI Realtime API**
- Talk to DeployPilotOS like you're on a conference call:
  - *"What's the current status?"*
  - *"What logs are you seeing?"*
  - *"Try restarting the API server"*
  - *"Roll back to the last stable version"*
  - *"What happened to cause this?"*
  - *"Send a status update to Slack"*
- DeployPilotOS responds in natural spoken voice (TTS)
- **Takes real actions** based on voice commands (Function Calling during voice session)
- Full transcript saved to incident timeline
- **This is the demo moment that wins the hackathon**

### 7. 🌐 Multi-Service Support
- Register unlimited services in the dashboard
- Each service has:
  - Name + environment (production/staging/dev)
  - Health check URL
  - Log source (file path, API, or webhook)
  - Deploy integration
  - Runbook library
  - Alert thresholds (customizable)
- **Service Map View**: Visual graph showing dependencies between services
- Incident correlation: "API-Service is down because DB-Service (its dependency) is down"
- **Global status page** — public-facing status page auto-generated and auto-updated

### BONUS: 📋 AI Post-Mortem Generator
- After incident resolves, DeployPilotOS automatically drafts the post-mortem:
  - Timeline of events
  - Root cause analysis
  - What went well / what went wrong
  - Action items to prevent recurrence
- Formatted as Markdown, exportable, editable before sharing

           Hypothesis forming: The deploy at 23:46:30 introduced a 
           change that exhausted the connection pool.

[23:47:05] 📋 Checking recent deploy history...
           → v2.4.1 deployed 1m 21s ago
           → Changed files: database/config.py, api/middleware.py
           → Diff shows pool_size reduced from 25 → 10 (REGRESSION)

[23:47:06] 🎯 Root Cause Identified (Confidence: 94%)
           
           Deploy v2.4.1 accidentally reduced connection pool size
           from 25 to 10 in database/config.py (line 47).
           Under normal load, the API requires ~18 connections.
           With pool_size=10, connections queue and timeout.

[23:47:06] 📚 Matching runbook... 
           → Found: "Connection Pool Exhaustion Recovery"
           → Similarity score: 0.94

[23:47:07] ⚙️ Executing Runbook Step 1/3:
           Increasing pool_size to 30 (safe margin above peak load)
           → Running: UPDATE db_config SET pool_size=30...
           → ✅ Done

[23:47:09] ⚙️ Executing Runbook Step 2/3:
           Restarting connection manager to apply config
           → Running: systemctl restart connection-manager
           → ✅ Done

[23:47:11] 🔄 Running health check...
           → API latency: 38ms (was 847ms) ✅
           → Error rate: 0.001% (was 23.4%) ✅
           → Connection pool utilization: 42% ✅

[23:47:12] ✅ INCIDENT RESOLVED — Total time: 9 seconds

           Root cause: Deploy v2.4.1 regression (pool_size 25→10)
           Actions taken: Increased pool_size to 30, restarted manager
           Recommendation: Fix config.py line 47 and redeploy

You are DeployPilotOS, an elite Site Reliability Engineer AI agent.
You have been activated to diagnose a production incident.

You think step-by-step, like a real senior engineer investigating an outage.
You are methodical, specific, and data-driven. You reference exact log lines, 
exact timestamps, and exact metrics.

You ALWAYS:
1. State what you're doing before you do it
2. Show the evidence you're examining
3. Form a clear hypothesis with confidence level
4. Recommend specific actions ordered by likelihood of success

You NEVER:
- Give vague answers
- Blame unknown causes without evidence
- Recommend actions without explaining why

SERVICE CONTEXT:
{serviceContext}

RECENT DEPLOY HISTORY:
{deployHistory}

CURRENT METRICS:
{currentMetrics}

RECENT LOGS (last 500 lines):
{recentLogs}

BASELINE (normal behavior):
{baseline}

Diagnose this incident. Think out loud. Be specific. Be fast.

export const VOICE_COMMANDER_PROMPT = `
You are DeployPilotOS, an AI SRE agent responding in a live incident war room.

You are speaking directly to a developer who needs rapid, clear information 
and decisive action. You speak in short, confident sentences. No filler. 
No unnecessary caveats. Like a senior engineer on a call.

Current incident context:
{incidentContext}

You have full access to all diagnostic tools and can take real actions.
When asked to take an action (restart, rollback, notify), do it immediately 
and confirm when done.

Keep responses under 3 sentences unless more detail is explicitly requested.
Use specific numbers and timestamps when possible.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (Judges Can Run in 3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeployPilotOS.git
cd DeployPilotOS && npm install

# 2. Add only your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env.local

# 3. Setup DB and run
npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push && npx prisma db seed && npm run dev
```

**Then open: `http://localhost:3000/demo`**

The demo mode pre-loads:
- 2 registered services (api-service + worker-service)
- 14 days of historical metrics
- 1 active P1 incident (in progress)
- 3 pre-built runbooks
- Full incident history with post-mortems

**Demo button:** `"Simulate Incident"` on any service triggers a fake incident and you watch the full AI diagnosis + auto-resolution flow live.

## 🏆 Why DeployPilotOS Wins Every Judging Category

| Criterion | DeployPilotOS's Edge |
|---|---|
| **Technological Implementation** | GPT-5.6 as reasoning agent, Realtime API voice, Function Calling for real actions, Embeddings for runbook matching, Streaming diagnosis, Structured Outputs, Assistants API memory, TTS, Moderation — fully agentic, not just chat |
| **Design** | War-room aesthetic is immediately impressive. Streaming AI investigation feed is unlike anything seen. Voice Commander is a jaw-dropping demo moment. |
| **Potential Impact** | $5,600/minute downtime cost. Every developer and every company needs this. Multi-billion dollar TAM. Immediately commercially viable. |
| **Quality of Idea** | Existing tools (Datadog, PagerDuty) only alert — they don't act. DeployPilotOS is the first agent that closes the loop autonomously. Genuinely novel category creation. |

## 📹 Demo Video Script (2:50 min — WINNING STRUCTURE)

**[0:00–0:15]** — Hook: Show 3 AM slack alert, blurry eyes developer, wall of logs. `"This happens to every dev team. DeployPilotOS ends this."`

**[0:15–0:35]** — Dashboard: Show services, all green. Click `"Simulate Incident"` button. Watch api-service flip to red. P1 alert appears.

**[0:35–1:20]** — Incident Investigation Feed: Watch the AI stream its thoughts in real-time. `"I'm seeing connection pool timeouts starting at 23:46:51... checking deploys... found regression in v2.4.1... matched runbook... executing step 1 of 3..."` This is the core wow moment. Let it breathe.

**[1:20–1:40]** — Auto-Rollback: Show AI detecting it was a bad deploy. Click of a button (or fully autonomous) — watch rollback trigger, health check pass, incident resolve. `"Total time: 12 seconds."`

**[1:40–2:10]** — Voice Commander: `"Now let's try it with voice."` Click Start War Room. Live conversation: `"What's the status?" / "What did you do?" / "Send a Slack update to the team."` AI speaks back, takes real actions.

**[2:10–2:25]** — Slack notification: Show the beautiful AI-written Slack message sent automatically.

**[2:25–2:50]** — Wrap: `"DeployPilotOS uses GPT-5.6, Realtime API, Function Calling, Embeddings, Structured Outputs, TTS — the complete OpenAI stack. This isn't a dashboard. It's the SRE engineer that never sleeps."` Show post-mortem auto-generated.
